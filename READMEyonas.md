Week 1: The goal is for us to talk about what we are gonna do, and think about what our most important functions will do before coding them.
Managed to configure the CMake 

Week 2: 
Helped some comrades with Cmake
Researched the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm, which is a optimized version of minimax.
I didnt implement it myself because Sacha Gregoire started writting it on his computer, thus i dont have any git stats for it but i helped him implement it (and i was the one doing the research, after Hai An Mai gave me the idea that we should use that algo)

Week 3:
Was sick so did not come to TD, but still worked on it at home.
Implemented bitboard attack for bishop and queen.
