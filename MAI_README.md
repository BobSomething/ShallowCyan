Made main.cpp to read the history file and output a move

Modified CMakeLists.txt to include libraries
Modified a bit board files and piece files to make it compile

December: 
I manage to move our implementation to a bitboard one.
Managed to implement all precomputed moves of leaper pieces, using Magic numbers.
Testing the move generation with perft tests (added fen notation for easier debug)

January:
Didn't do much, help distribute the work for the teammates.
Made some templates for the teammates to help then implement features of the bot, i.e. positional evaluation, move generation of not leaper pieces.
Added some improvements to evaluation function.
